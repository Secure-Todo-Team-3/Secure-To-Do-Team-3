crash.log             # Terraform crash logs

# Terraform variable definition files that might contain sensitive data
# Only ignore these if you're managing sensitive variables via other means (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, GitHub Secrets, CI/CD environment variables)
# If you use a '.tfvars' file for non-sensitive, shared variables, you might NOT want to ignore it.
*.tfvars              # Generic .tfvars files
*.tfvars.json         # Generic .tfvars.json files
# terraform.tfvars    # Uncomment if you want to ignore the default auto-loaded tfvars file
# terraform.tfvars.json # Uncomment if you want to ignore the default auto-loaded tfvars.json file

# Files generated by the 'archive_file' data source
# (e.g., app-bundle.zip for Elastic Beanstalk deployments)
*.zip                 # General zip files, be careful if you have other zips you DO want to commit
*.tar.gz              # General tar.gz files
*.tar                 # General tar files
*.exe
# Provider-specific files (less common in .terraform/ but good to include)
.terraform.d/         # Custom plugin directories

# Personal configuration files (should not be committed)
.terraformrc          # User-specific Terraform configuration file
terraform.rc          # User-specific Terraform configuration file

# IDE / Editor specific files (often placed in root .gitignore, but can be here too)
.DS_Store             # macOS specific files
*.log                 # General log files
